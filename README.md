Electrostatic Simulator
===

A software package to find numerical solutions of potential in electrostatic problems.
Project of P2 Group 1.

Repository structure
---

- `app` directory encapsulates the whole simulating programme
- `design` directory contains all files of an app design and modules specification
- `samples` directory of samples and experimental bits of code 
Feel free to create more directories here if you need them, but ask me first or at least let me know what is its purpose. Otherwise, please hold the structure given above.

Basics of working with Git and GitHub
---

In order to work on our project I would recommend for everyone to set up your local copy of this repository. This can be easily done in console by `git clone http://github.com/dupejpeter/ESS.git` or using equivalent command (usually clone existing repository) in any system Github clients.

If you already have your local repository, make sure you synchronise your local repository before you start making any changes. Use `git pull` to do this (or press sync button in your client). If this fails for any reason get in touch, but usually reinitialising repository (delete and clone it from origin again) should solve everything.

To avoid getting into conflicts when two people change the same file at a same time, I recommend everyone to work in their own separate branch. This should not be a smaller issue if we will split the app into modules so that everyone can work on a separate part of it without interfering with others. I would then check they all work together and merge them into a master branch. When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch. You can call your branch whatever you like or you can call it by the name of the module you are working on.

In case of any questions get in touch with me either on dupejpeter@gmail.com or on Facebook. You can create issues with problems you have and discuss them with other under the issue topic. Then you can close the issue by assigning a commit to it.
