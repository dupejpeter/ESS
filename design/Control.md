User first has to Fill Grid with some initial boundary data. Therefore in the first menu `Fill Grid` there are 5 options:

- AnalyticProbA
- NumericProbA
- NumericProbC
- Custom Grid
- Import from file

In first 4 cases user defined size of a Grid is required to create a Grid. In the case of import the size of a grid will be determined based on the data file.

For the prepared ProbA and ProbB cases user will be asked for +V, -V and GND potential value if necessary then the grid will be filled with corresponding data.

Import will require a query for filename and optionally type of the imported file.

For the simulation user only has to specify a change threshold and/or maxIteration to stop the simulation iterating.

After the simulation is done program will ask for .dat filename to save the result of the simulation and give user options for saving/exporting results (coloured potential map, equi potential lines, electric field lines).  

@TODO Analytic vs. Numeric difference
